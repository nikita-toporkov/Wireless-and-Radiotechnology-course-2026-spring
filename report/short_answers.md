# Short Answers (Lecture-2)

 

## Q1

What is the difference between time domain and frequency domain?

On Time domain signal are functions of time, showing changes of amplitude.
On Frequency domain all the components of the spectrum are visible, but no information how they change over time.

## Q2

Why does filtering help in RF receivers?
When building RF receiver, signal parameters are specified. If expected signal's frequency range known - filtering can be applied to reduce everything else. 

## Q3

What does modulation achieve in an RF system?
Modulation is "enveloping" information into one of the Electro Magnetic Wave's parameters. 

## Q4

From A2: which filter was easiest to design and why?
low pass with finite impulse response

## Q5

From A3: where do the new frequency components appear after modulation?
on the frequency domain. In case of Amplitude Modulation - two peaks on frequency Fcarrier+-Fsignal
