% Butterworth Lowpass filter designed using FDESIGN.LOWPASS.

% All frequency values are in Hz.
Fs = 4000;  % Sampling Frequency

N  = 10;   % Order
Fc = 100;  % Cutoff Frequency

% Construct an FDESIGN object and call its BUTTER method.
h  = fdesign.lowpass('N,F3dB', N, Fc, Fs);
Hd = design(h, 'butter');
